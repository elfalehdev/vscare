# VsCare

What's vscare ❓
Vscare is a vscode extension that takes care of you. I am building this extension so it take care of developers while coding i.e. their coding rhythm and health - Like How? 😕
Developers don't really care how many hours they keep staring at their screens with bad postures.  

VsCare is going to be a good reminder for you and guide you through a happy coding session. ✔️
